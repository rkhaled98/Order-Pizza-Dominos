# Order-Pizza-Dominos
Order Pizza from Dominos interactively from the terminal

This is an unfinished project that uses the pizzapi Python wrapper for the Dominos Pizza API (https://github.com/gamagori/pizzapi) to create an interactive Python application to order Dominos using a FSM.

To use it in its current, barely functioning form, simply run 
```sh
$ python3 order_pizza.py
```

Make sure to have pizzapi available. It can be downloaded with the above link.
